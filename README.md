# VeSync Binding

Please note this binding has now been merged to the openhab addon's repo.

During the PR review process, subtle naming corrections were done to update it to the standard conventions, such as AirHumidifier -> airHumidifier, minor channel renames and unit addition's and data type corrections. The core functionality remains the same, but minor updates to channel names, etc... will be required.

It's current support is for the Air purifiers & Humidifer's branded as Levoit which utilise the VeSync app based on the V2 protocol.

A port of the checkin for v4 Milestone 2 (done when Milestone 1) is/was available, for the 3.4.x version is under the manual builds directory.
